# Home Automation System
IoT-based Home Automation System is a project that attempts to give consumers an automated way to control the equipment in their homes using a web application from anywhere on the planet. The project is planned and implemented using C++ language using the Arduino IDE.

With home automation, you may access and manage your house's appliances from any location in the globe using a mobile device. Homes with practically everything connected to a remotely controllable network, including lighting, appliances, electrical outlets, heating and cooling systems, are more appropriately referred to as home automation. This also includes automated doors, gas detection systems, fire alarms, and many more sensors from the perspective of home security.

## Objectives
1. The Internet of Things (IoT) is aimed at enabling the interconnection and integration of the physical world and the cyber space.
2. The fundamental objective of IoT is to obtain and analyze data from things (devices) that were previously disconnected from most data processing tools.
3. Our project model consists of two main parts: an android application that will serve as the user interface for controlling the circuit and the appliances connected to it from a distance, and a circuit that is integrated into the user's home.
4. Only authorised people will have the right to access the system and the system administrator can authorise people that can access it.
