# Home Automation System

IoT-based Home Automation System is a project that attempts to give consumers an automated way to control the equipment in their homes using a web application from anywhere on the planet. The project is planned and implemented using C++ language using the Arduino IDE.

## Objectives
•	The fundamental objective of IoT is to obtain and analyze data from things (devices) that were previously disconnected from most data processing tools.
•	Our project model consists of two main parts: an android application that will serve as the user interface for controlling the circuit and the appliances connected to it from a distance, and a circuit that is integrated into the user's home.
•	Only authorised people will have the right to access the system and the system administrator can authorise people that can access it.
